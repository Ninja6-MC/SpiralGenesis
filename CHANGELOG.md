## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.0] - 2026-08-18

First published build. Everything below has been in the repository since the initial
commit; this is the point at which it became downloadable.

### Changed
- Spawn allocation now searches **within** a cell before abandoning it. Previously a single
  unsafe block at the cell centre discarded the whole `cell-size` plot and permanently
  consumed a spiral index; candidates are now probed outward from the centre first
  (`placement.stride`, `placement.max-candidates`).
- Candidates are rejected when they sit below the surrounding terrain
  (`safety.max-pit-depth`), when their surroundings are too uneven
  (`safety.max-roughness`), when lava or powder snow is adjacent, or when there is no
  headroom for a player. This is what keeps spawns out of ravines, sinkholes and cliff
  edges, whose floors the heightmap reports as "the surface".
- Exhausting `safety.max-scan-attempts` now settles on the best candidate seen during the
  scan rather than whichever one happened to be probed last.
- `safety.max-scan-attempts` now defaults to `8` rather than `50`. Worst-case allocation is
  `max-scan-attempts * max-candidates` ticks, and cells rarely fail outright now that the
  search looks inside them.

### Added
- Tagging a release now publishes to Modrinth and Paper Hangar as well as GitHub
  Releases. Both steps are skipped when their token is absent, so a tag can be cut
  before the registry projects exist. Release notes come from this file.
- The release workflow rejects malformed tags and refuses to publish a stable release
  whose version has no changelog section.
- `placement.strategy` — `FIRST_SAFE` (default, keeps the player at the cell centre when it
  is viable and stops probing there), `FLATTEST`, or `HIGHEST` with a `height-ceiling` that
  keeps ranking off jagged peaks.
- `/sgen simulate <count>` — runs allocation against the live world and reports indices
  consumed per spawn, fallbacks, surface range, and a per-rule rejection breakdown. Uses a
  throwaway counter, so it never advances the live spiral index. Allocation is otherwise
  only reachable by a player joining, which made the terrain rules untestable without a
  game client.
- CI now drives `/sgen simulate` against a generated world and fails on regressions in
  index burn, fallback use, or spawns below `min-surface-y` — so a safety threshold that is
  too strict for real terrain is caught before release.
- `scripts/dev-server.sh` for local testing. `./gradlew runServer` is currently unusable:
  run-paper 2.x resolves servers through PaperMC's retired v2 API, and the 3.x line that
  speaks v3 requires Gradle 9.
- `.gitattributes` pinning shell scripts to LF. With `core.autocrlf=true`, `gradlew` was
  checked out with CRLF and failed under bash with `/bin/sh^M: bad interpreter`.
- Initial project scaffolding with Gradle Kotlin DSL and Java 21 toolchain.
- Deterministic 2D square spiral coordinate transformation engine (`SpiralMath`).
- Asynchronous Paper chunk and heightmap probing with ocean and hazard filtering (`SpawnManager`).
- Cross-play authentication parity for Bedrock (`Floodgate`) and Java (`AuthMe-Reloaded`).
- Persistent per-player YAML storage (`data.yml`).
- Administrative `/sgen` command suite (`setcenter`, `setspawn`, `reassign`, `tp`, `info`, `reload`).
- Automated multi-tier release workflows for GitHub Releases, Modrinth, and Paper Hangar.
- JUnit 5 test suite for mathematical verification.
